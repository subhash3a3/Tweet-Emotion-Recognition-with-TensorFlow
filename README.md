# Tweet-Emotion-Recognition-with-TensorFlow

This repository consists of the project code and other details which I learnt from coursera project network.

In this project, I created a recurrent neural network and trained it on a tweet emotion dataset to learn to recognize emotions in tweets. This is a multi class classification problem in the natural language processing domain.
